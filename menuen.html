    <h2> What is Super Panayotis Iliad? </h2>
    <h3>
   Super Panayotis Iliad is a videogame made for a school project by
  George. It is a pretty simplistic game design inspired by Super Mario. Basically you are a fisherman that wants to make a Greek salad for your family, but you can't find the ingredients, so you go to a journey around the Mediterranean to find the best and tastiest ingredients.

    <h2> Who is Panayotis? </h2> 
    <h3>
  Panayotis is the name of the main character of the game. George decided on Panayotis when he was brainstorming for different Greek names.  He says that Panayotis is a good name because it is a pretty famous Greek name, but also a unique name for people who don't speak Greek.

    <h2>How long did it take to develop?  </h2>
  <h3>
  In total he has spent over 4 weeks preparing the Website and over 20 weeks programming and drawing the game. The original plan was just to make the game, but as the last couple of weeks came, he got an idea to make the game more interesting. His final decision came, and he chose to make a website to compliment and clarify the video game to potential customers.

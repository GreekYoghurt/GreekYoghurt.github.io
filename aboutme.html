    <h2> Who even am I? </h2>
    <h3> My name is George III of Athens and I'm 15 years old. I am as you may have guessed Greek. I was born and pretty much raised in Greece, but during my childhood I moved to Switzerland. My mother tongue is Greek, but I can also communicate in English, and German. In my free time I enjoy drawing, programming, playing basketball, and reading something online. I have spent countless hours learning history, math, and even physics in my free time, because as a Greek I need to be academically gifted. In my game you can find a couple of history facts about Alexander the Great and about other Greek historic Characters, or traditions. This isn't a big or complicated game because this is my first ever game, made completely by me. (and some help from my brother) After this I am planning to make an old fashioned 3D game about the Greek war of independence of 1821. I have noticed how much time it takes to create a game, and a lot of indie game designers have earned my respect. In Panayotis I had a time limit, and I think that, that really made it a little more stressful, but for my next game I will have no limit and I hope that I'll stay consistent and truly make it an enjoyable game.

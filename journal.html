    <h2> Background story </h2>
    <h3> There once was a man called Panayotis. A very wise man some would say. He was born in 1997 and raised in Makedonia. One Christmas when he was 25, he was trying to prepare a Greek salad for his family. (This was the tradition for the past 26 since Alexander the great died)
      As he was ready to take out the tasty cucumber, the juicy tomatoes, the astonishing  feta cheese, the beautiful peppers, the monochrome shiny olives and the freshly made olive oil, he noticed that all of the ingredients were missing! He was panicking like never before, he turned the room upside down to find them but yet he still didn't find them. So he prepared himself for the journey of his life. He wanted to get the freshest and best fruits in all of the World. And his Journey started there. </h3>
   
    <h2> Level 1 / Makedonia </h2>
    <h3>He first went from his home in Thessaloniki (Capital of Makedonia) to the airport in Athens. He would have gone to the airport in Thessaloniki, but because of the Alpha virus he needs to wear a mask there, but as any Greek the nose just tears the mask in half because of its size. Anyways in his way to his first checkpoint (The temple of Zeus) he saw some disturbing and disgusting creature. It looked like a molded olive and it had legs and it could move! He was scared because he had no idea how to deal with it. He just gathered all his strength and tried to jump over it, but he ends up falling on it! By his surprise he squished the olive and it died. Finally after jumping over some death traps, jumping from pillar to pillar over the lava and squishing a couple of olives, he finally arrived at his destination. 
    </h3>
    
    <h2> Level 2 / Temple of Zeus </h2>
    
    <h3> When he arrived at the temple of zeus it was late in the night and he wanted to sleep. So first he prayed to the almighty god Zeus and right after that he laid down on his bed. Because it was attacked 2300 years ago there were no beds so to make his bed, he took some wheat from the backyard for a mattress and some flowers for a pillow.
      Never the less he slept pretty good that night. After he woke up it was nice and bright outside, he made some tea from the flowers he found in the backyard, and ate some fresh nectar. (Some people say the nectar he found was sent by the god Zeus for a gift)
      After that delicious breakfast he started his adventure and jumped over obstacles and killed some nasty olives. He was pretty close to the airport of Athens and he finally got there.

    <h2> Level 3 / Airport of Athens </h2>
    
    <h3> First he lay down on his bed. There was no bed, so he took some wheat from the garden as a mattress and some flowers as a pillow.
      Nevertheless, he slept quite well that night. When he woke up, it was nice and bright outside, he made himself some tea from the flowers he found in the garden and ate some fresh nectar. (Some people say that the nectar he found was sent as a gift from the god Zeus).
      After this delicious breakfast, he began his adventure. To his surprise, there were no olive gators but peace and sunshine. He took his time to go to the plane because it was so beautiful and quiet outside.
    
     </h3>
    
  <h2> Level 4 / Airplane </h2>
    
    <h3> It was his first time going somewhere by plane, since he is a fisherman and normally goes everywhere he can with a ship. The reason he didn't take his ship this time is because his crew wont be able to come, again because of the Alpha-Virus. Technically he could sail alone, but its too dangerous since he owed money to Poseidon for taking his trident to catch fish, he wouldn't let him. And the other reason is because with the Trident he could breathe underwater and he took that opportunity to go down to Atlantis to act like the king of Atlantis and trick the people into praying to him instead of Poseidon. So the people in Atlantis also don't support him. Anyways in the Airplane he was kind of scared, because as a Fisherman he never seen other people except himself, his family, his crew and the gods. So when he saw that there are hundreds of people next to him it added on to his fear of heights. The flight took 2 hours and after 1 hour the flight attendant came up to him and asked him, what he would like to eat. He asked to see the menu and she gave it to him. He saw that they had Olives and fresh Cucumber, as much as he wanted to take the Olives he couldn't because he knew he came for the Cucumber of Cyprus so he chose  the cucumber and waited. Since the flight was only 2 hours when he arrived it was just as beautiful as when he left. He went into the Airport of Nicosia and waited for the next flight.
  </h3>
    
    <h2> Level 5 / Cyprus </h2>
    <h3>When he arrived at the Airport he relaxed for a little bit and he had a decision to make. It was either he was going to stay and wait 4.5 hours for the next flight, or he was going to find another way to get to his next destination. He thought about it for 10 minutes but then decided to find another way. He walked across the whole coast of Cyprus even inside the "Turkish part". At the end he found a Turkish ship, and as much as he wanted to destroy it (as he was taught by his ancestors) he didn't. Instead he went inside and started speaking a mixture of some Turkish, German, Greek and English. He said: "Καλημέρα, yapabilir miyim take your πλοίο für ein Bisschen? " They understood him and took him with them... </h3>
